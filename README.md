# Node Notes

### Brief
A note taking markup language based on Github's own MarkDown langauge. It uses a custom compiler written in Java that takes in the custom markup langauge and outputs an HTML file.

### TODO:
* Create a PDF output 
* Use React.js to create a platform for writing in this language
* Create support for the platform to take other markup variations
* Create organizational apps based on the NodeNotes nodes.

### Compiler Steps
1. Tokenizer âˆš
2. Syntax Analyzer (produce AST)
